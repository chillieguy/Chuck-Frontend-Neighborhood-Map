This is project 5 for the [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) Frontend Nanodegree. The goal of the project was to create an interactive map that utilized Google Maps and a third party API to pull in information about a town or neighborhood of our choosing.

I picked a project that lists breweries in Bend, OR and pulls information from FourSquare.

###To Do
* Remove the need to create a list of breweries.  Have Google Maps pass a lat/long to FourSquare and generate a list of breweries
* Hyperlink twitter account and website in Google Maps Info box
* Work on responsive design.  I am not completely happy with the way I have handle small screens.  Research Bootstrap (I attempted this, but Google Maps was not playing nice).
